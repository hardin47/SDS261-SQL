Use SQL to delete records from a table.\nBasics of Regular Expressions: understand the fundamental concepts of regular expressions.

You must do two new items (one each).\nNote that the event of interest is “visit to primary care physician.”\nBe as creative as possible trying to think about how you might like to graphically display the data. If you come up with a cool idea for a graph but don’t know how to implement it, please let me know, and I will write the code for you!!\nPlease do not re-code the variables or change the variable names outside of R. You may, however, transform (mutate()) the variables within your R code (that is, for example, if you wanted to divide months by 12 to have years, or square a variable, etc.).\n\n\n\n\nYour primary assessment will be based on the above items (modeling, understanding of new topic, additional analysis, interpretation).\nAdditionally there will be two competitions. Winning either will add 5 points (out of 100) to your score.\n\nGraphic: the class will vote on who has the best graphic.\nModel: using a holdout sample (I only gave you part of the data), I will assess your final model.

    "text": "Big picture\nYour project is meant to answer a question using data. The vast majority of the work will be on the data wrangling side, but you might hope to have a plot or two at the end to help tie together your ideas.\n\nTopics\nThe topics above are meant to direct the project productively. They are not meant to limit you. If you have an idea for a project that doesn’t quite fit into what is outlined above (but is related to the course content), let’s talk about it! Most likely, your idea will fit into the project goals.\nExpanding on the topics above to get you started…\n\nSQL queries\nThroughout the course, we’ve seen a few different databases. There are more available in the R mdsr package, and you also have access to some additional MySQL server databases through Smith. Additionally, the professor has access to a MySQL server that contains all of the Stanford Open Policing data, and you are welcome to work with it (just ask for login information). So many interesting questions to consider!\n\n\nRegular expressions\nYou might think about web scraping to retrieve data (probably using the rvest R package). For example, you might scrape every Taylor Swift song and use regular expressions to format the information in a way that allows easy question asking.\nOr you might find a dataset on the Gilmore Girls and scrape IMDb to match the ratings for each episode.\n\n\nCreating SQL database\nYou can use any of a variety of platforms to create a SQL database. As in the class notes, you can create a database using DuckDB. Alternatively, you can use Smith’s MySQL server. Or, you can use SQLite to create a database (in a similar way to DuckDB).\nFor example, you might create a database using the Saturday Night Live data and update all of the files with more recent episodes.\nOr you might look for a TidyTuesday dataset to upload. For example, consider data on cats in the UK which references similar datasets in the US, Australia, and New Zealand."

If you plan to turn in the project in a different format, please check with the professor in advance.\n\n\nDue Dates\n\nTuesday, January 16. Email prof with dataset details and idea for project. Include the following:\n\nQuestion of interest that you hope to address.\nHolistic description of the dataset(s) (a few sentences).\nDescription of the observational units and columns in each data table.\nFull reference for data citation.\nLink to the resources.\n\nEnd of week 2. We will have some time in class to work on the project.\nTuesday, January 23. Completed project is due."
